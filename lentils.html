        <h2>recipe</h2>
        <p>** note! this is a super flexible and fun recipe.  taste as you go.  you'll figure out what ~ feels right in your heart ~</p>
        <p>** if you want meat -- esp chicken -- a fun marinade is yogurt with spices, salt, pepper, and garlic.  depending on the size of your meat chunks, throw it in before or after the veg.  i usually like to do it after so it doesn't get overcooked.</p>
        <p>** it's a flexible recipe.  what you basically need is a spice mix you like and a fat source.  greek yogurt rounds out the flavor really nicely but you can experiment with coconut oil and such.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>start to cook the onions!  you can cook them in butter, canola oil, or coconut oil.</li>
            <li>season the onions!!  with the spices everything is really what you want it to be.  (if you have a curry mix that's what you should put the most in.)  a nice trick is to put a good amount of spice in with the onions -- beacuse it's going to go a longer way and tastes better if you add it at this stage rather than later.  make sure the heat isn't too high.</li>
            <li>once your onions are starting to cook, throw in some garlic!</li>
            <li>if you have uncooked veg, now is a great time to start to add it.  spice and taste as you go.</li>
            <li>after the onions, garlic, and possible veg have cooked, start adding the tomatoes.  idk how much you should put in.  put what feels right.  remember to keep tasting and spicing.</li>
            <li>add the yogurt if you have it.  milk also works.</li>
            <li>IS SHIT COOKING AND SOLID?  fab.  put in those mother fucking lentils.  add water or broth.  let it simmer.  cover or don't.</li>
            <li>tbh i have no idea how long lentils actually cook for.  feel like it's 20-30 minutes usually.  you can keep taste testing until the lentils feel soft.</li>
